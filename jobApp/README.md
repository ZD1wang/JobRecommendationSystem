# Job Recommendation System

## Introduction
In todayâ€™s data-driven world, where the job descriptions are closely connected and often overlapping, it is hard for students to determine where they would fit best. I am interested in determining what type of IT-related job would be the most suitable in terms of skill-matching and job competence for an IT professional. 

## Models
* FFN Model (https://github.com/ggeop/Job-Recommendation-Engine/blob/master/Code/Keras-Models/FFN%20Model%20Testing.ipynb)
* Sequential Model (https://github.com/ggeop/Job-Recommendation-Engine/blob/master/Code/Keras-Models/Keras%20First%20Go.ipynb)
* Sequential Model + Embedding layer (https://github.com/ggeop/Job-Recommendation-Engine/blob/master/Code/Keras-Models/Second%20Model.ipynb)
* CNN Model (https://github.com/ggeop/Deep-Learning-Project/blob/master/Code/Keras-Models/Testing%20Area-CNN.ipynb)

### Best Model results
Finally, our best result was the sequential model (https://github.com/ggeop/Deep-Learning-Project/blob/master/Code/Keras-Models/Keras%20Best%20Model.ipynb)
In the following images you can see the performance of the model in test & validation dataset
